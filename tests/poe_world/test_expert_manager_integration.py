Integration test for ExpertManager with ObjectModelOrchestrator using real Crafter components.

This test validates that the full pipeline works end-to-end with:
1. Real CrafterExpertSynthesizer (LLM-based expert generation)
2. CrafterObservableExtractor
3. MaxLikelihoodWeightFitter
4. ExpertManager
5. ObjectModelOrchestrator

The test uses simple movement transitions to trigger expert synthesis.
