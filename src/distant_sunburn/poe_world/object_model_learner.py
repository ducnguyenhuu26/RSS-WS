"""
Generic Object Model Orchestrator for PoE-World.

This module implements the core learning orchestration from the external
poe-world implementation, providing a generic framework for object-specific
world model learning.

ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
This module corresponds to the ObjModelLearner class in external poe-world.
The key insight is that the orchestrator manages the learning process for
a specific object type by:

1. Owning two expert managers (non-creation and creation experts)
2. Accumulating transitions over time
3. Running the learning loop that identifies surprising transitions
4. Synthesizing new experts and adding them to the appropriate manager
5. Fitting weights to all experts using accumulated data
6. Pruning useless experts
7. Returning a composed ObjectTypeModel

The structure mirrors external poe-world:
- ObjectModelOrchestrator (this class) = ObjModelLearner
- ObjectTypeModel = ObjTypeModel (data structure containing learned experts)
- ExpertManagerProtocol = MoEObjModel (manages experts and their weights)
