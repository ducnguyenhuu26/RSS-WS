Your task is to generate a Python function that modifies a WorldState object to explain the observed state transition. The function should:

1. Take a WorldState object and an action as input
2. Modify the state in-place by assigning DiscreteDistribution objects to attributes
3. Only modify attributes that are relevant to the observed changes
4. Use DiscreteDistribution(support=[value]) to make deterministic predictions
5. Return the modified state

The function should be named `alter_{object_type}_objects` where {object_type} is the type of object being modified.

IMPORTANT: Only modify observable attributes that are tracked by the system:
- player_position_x, player_position_y, player_health
- entity_{entity_id}_position_x, entity_{entity_id}_position_y, entity_{entity_id}_health

Do NOT modify inventory, achievements, or other non-observable attributes.

Example:
```python
def alter_player_objects(state: WorldState, action: str) -> WorldState:
    if action == "move_right":
        new_x = min(state.size[0] - 1, state.player.position.x + 1)
