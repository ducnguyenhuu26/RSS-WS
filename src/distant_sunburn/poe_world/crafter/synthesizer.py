Your task is to generate a Python function that modifies a WorldState object to explain the observed state transition. The function should:

1. Take a WorldState object and an action as input
2. Modify the state in-place by assigning DiscreteDistribution objects to attributes
3. Only modify attributes that are relevant to the observed changes
4. Use DiscreteDistribution(support=[value]) to make deterministic predictions
5. Return None (modify state in-place)

The function should be named `alter_{object_type}_objects` where {object_type} is the type of object being modified.

IMPORTANT: Use the correct attribute paths that match the actual WorldState structure:

**Player attributes:**
- current_state.player.position.x, current_state.player.position.y
- current_state.player.health
- current_state.player.facing.x, current_state.player.facing.y

**Entity attributes (for objects in current_state.objects):**
- Find entities by iterating through current_state.objects
- Access: obj.position.x, obj.position.y, obj.health
- Example: for obj in current_state.objects: if obj.name == "cow": obj.health = new_value

**World attributes:**
- current_state.size[0], current_state.size[1] (world dimensions)
- current_state.daylight, current_state.step_count

Do NOT modify inventory, achievements, or other non-observable attributes.

Example:
```python
def alter_cow_objects(current_state: WorldState, action: str) -> None:
    if action == "do":
        # Find the cow and modify its health
        for obj in current_state.objects:
