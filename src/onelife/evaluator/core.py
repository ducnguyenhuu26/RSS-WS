"""
Core interfaces and classes for the hybrid evaluation framework.

This module defines protocols, data structures, and the `Evaluator` that provide
environment-agnostic evaluation of symbolic world models. The statistical
aggregation implemented here is intentional and optimized for a specific
question: how good and how stable is a world model across a set of scenarios
that each represent a distinct game mechanic?

Guiding principles for aggregation (do not "correct" without understanding):

- Scenarios are the fundamental unit of evaluation. Each scenario (transition
  source) targets a distinct mechanic; in aggregate reporting, each scenario is
  weighted equally regardless of how many transitions it contains. A long
  scenario must not dominate a short one.
- We explicitly distinguish two types of variation:
  - Inter-Scenario Variation: performance differences between mechanics.
  - Intra-Scenario Variation: trial-to-trial variation on the same mechanic due
    to stochasticity or sampling. Our reported standard deviation focuses on
    this.
- Primary goal: measure Intra-Scenario Variation (stability). When comparing two
  models, average performance is insufficient; a slightly lower mean with a much
  lower standard deviation may be preferable.

Interpreting results:

- To compare two models on a specific mechanic, use the per-scenario entries in
  `metrics_by_source` (`"mean"` and `"std"`).
- To compare overall performance, use the top-level mean in `EvaluationResults`.
- To compare overall stability/consistency, use the top-level standard deviation
  in `EvaluationResults`. This number represents the average trial-to-trial
  variability on a typical mechanic.

Alternatives intentionally rejected:

- A single standard deviation computed over all transitions from all trials
  would overweight scenarios with more transitions (violates equal weighting).
- The standard deviation of scenario means measures Inter-Scenario Variation
  (differences between mechanics). That is interesting but not our target; we
  want the average Intra-Scenario Variation (stability) instead.
