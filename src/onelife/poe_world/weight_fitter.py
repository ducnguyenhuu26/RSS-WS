        Build per-support buckets of loss inputs for vectorized computation.

        This routine flattens the (transition, attribute) pairs into "items" and groups
        items by their unified support so that we can batch them without padding. The
        grouping is extractor-agnostic and uses only `DiscreteDistribution` and the
        protocol methods of the `ObservableExtractor` passed at construction.

        Dataflow (per item):
        1) Take observed outcome for attribute from `next_metadata`.
        2) Collect each expert's predicted `DiscreteDistribution` for that attribute for
           the specific transition. If any expert is missing the attribute, skip item.
        3) Compute the union of supports across experts (1D int array of length V).
        4) Expand every expert distribution to this union using noise of LOGSCORE_FLOOR.
        5) Record the observed index `obs_idx` in the union support if present; otherwise
           mark as not present.

        Bucketing: Items with the same union support array (same content and length)
        are grouped into a bucket. For each bucket we produce tensors:
        - logscores: float32 tensor of shape [B, E, V]
            B: number of items in the bucket
            E: number of experts
            V: number of values in this bucket's support
            Entry [b, e, v] is the logscore expert e assigns to support[v] for item b.
            Values are sanitized and clamped at LOGSCORE_FLOOR.
        - obs_idx: int64 tensor of shape [B]
            Index into the last dimension (V) of `logscores`/combined logits for the
            observed outcome for item b. When observed outcome is not present in the
            union support, this index is set to 0 (unused placeholder) and a mask is used.
        - obs_present: bool tensor of shape [B]
            True if the observed outcome is in the union support, False otherwise.
        - support: int32 tensor of shape [V]
            The actual support values for this bucket. Not used in the hot path; kept
            for diagnostics and symmetry with the scalar path.

        Args:
            transitions: Training transitions in the sampled batch.
            expert_preds_per_transition: Precomputed expert predictions matching
                `transitions`: list over transitions → list over experts → dict
                mapping ObservableId → DiscreteDistribution.
            device: Optional torch device to place resulting tensors on. If None,
                uses CPU. For GPU execution, pass `weights.device`.

        Returns:
            A list of bucket dictionaries with keys: `logscores`, `obs_idx`,
            `obs_present`, `support`.
