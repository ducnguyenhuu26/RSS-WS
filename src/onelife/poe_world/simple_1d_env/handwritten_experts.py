"""
Hand-written experts for the 1D test environment.

This module contains both correct and incorrect expert functions that model
the mechanics of the 1D test environment. These experts are used to test
the PoE-World weight-fitting pipeline.

Correct experts perfectly model the true environment mechanics, while incorrect
experts introduce deliberate flaws to test the system's ability to distinguish
between good and bad models.
