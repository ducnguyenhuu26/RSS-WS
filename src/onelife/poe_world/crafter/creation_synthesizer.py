        return """You are an expert at analyzing game state transitions and generating Python functions that explain object lifecycle events.

Your task is to generate a Python function that modifies a WorldState object to explain observed object creation, deletion, or replacement events. The function should:

1. Take a WorldState object and an action as input
2. Modify the state in-place by:
   - Creating new objects and appending them to current_state.objects
   - Deleting existing objects by removing them from current_state.objects
   - Replacing objects by deleting old ones and creating new ones
3. Use DiscreteDistribution(support=[value]) for probabilistic predictions
4. Return None (modify state in-place)

The function should be named `alter_{object_type}_objects` where {object_type} is the type of object being modified.

IMPORTANT: Use the correct object creation and deletion patterns:

**Creating new objects:**
- Instantiate the appropriate state class (e.g., CowState, ZombieState)
- Set entity_id to a unique value (use current_state.entity_id_counter_state + offset)
- Set position, health, and other required attributes
- Append to current_state.objects

**Deleting objects:**
- Find objects by name and remove them from current_state.objects using list operations
- Use list comprehension or filter to create a new objects list without the deleted objects

**Example creation:**
```python
def alter_cow_objects(current_state: WorldState, action: str) -> None:
    if action == "spawn_cow":
        # Create a new cow at a specific position
        new_cow = CowState(
            entity_id=current_state.entity_id_counter_state + 1,
            position=Position(x=50, y=30),
            health=10,
            name="cow"
        )
        current_state.objects.append(new_cow)
```

**Deletion Pattern:**
```python
# To delete objects, use list comprehension with appropriate conditions:
# current_state.objects = [obj for obj in current_state.objects if <keep_condition>]
# 
# Examples:
# - Keep all objects except zombies: if obj.name != "zombie"
# - Keep all objects except zombies at position (10, 20): if not (obj.name == "zombie" and obj.position.x == 10 and obj.position.y == 20)
# - Keep all objects except zombies with health <= 0: if not (obj.name == "zombie" and obj.health <= 0)
```

**Example replacement:**
```python
def alter_plant_objects(current_state: WorldState, action: str) -> None:
    if action == "grow_plant":
        # Remove old plants and create new ones
        current_state.objects = [obj for obj in current_state.objects if obj.name != "plant"]
        
        # Create new plant
        new_plant = PlantState(
            entity_id=current_state.entity_id_counter_state + 1,
            position=Position(x=25, y=35),
            health=5,
            name="plant",
            grown=10,
            ripe=True
        )
        current_state.objects.append(new_plant)
```

        prompt = f"""Analyze this state transition and generate a Python function that explains the object lifecycle changes:

**Action:** {transition.action}

**Key Lifecycle Changes:**
{changes}

**Object Type:** {object_type}

Please generate a Python function named `alter_{object_type}_objects` that explains these lifecycle changes. The function should:
- Take `current_state: WorldState` and `action: str` as parameters
- Modify the current_state in-place by creating, deleting, or replacing objects
- Return None
- Handle object lifecycle events:
  * Object creation: Instantiate state classes and append to current_state.objects
  * Object deletion: Remove objects from current_state.objects using list operations
  * Object replacement: Delete old objects and create new ones

**WorldState Structure:**
- `current_state.objects`: List of game objects (PlayerState, CowState, ZombieState, etc.)
- `current_state.entity_id_counter_state`: Integer counter for generating unique entity IDs
- `current_state.size`: Tuple of (width, height) for world dimensions
- `current_state.player`: PlayerState object representing the player

**Available Object Types and Their Required Attributes:**

**CowState:**
- entity_id: int
- position: Position(x: int, y: int)
- health: int
- name: str (must be "cow")

**ZombieState:**
- entity_id: int
- position: Position(x: int, y: int)
- health: int
- name: str (must be "zombie")
- cooldown: int

**SkeletonState:**
- entity_id: int
- position: Position(x: int, y: int)
- health: int
- name: str (must be "skeleton")
- reload: int

**ArrowState:**
- entity_id: int
- position: Position(x: int, y: int)
- health: int
- name: str (must be "arrow")
- facing: Position(x: int, y: int)

**PlantState:**
- entity_id: int
- position: Position(x: int, y: int)
- health: int
- name: str (must be "plant")
- grown: int
- ripe: bool

**FenceState:**
- entity_id: int
- position: Position(x: int, y: int)
- health: int
- name: str (must be "fence")

**Position Class:**
- x: int
- y: int

**Important Notes:**
- Always use `current_state.entity_id_counter_state + offset` for new entity IDs
- Use list comprehension to remove objects: `current_state.objects = [obj for obj in current_state.objects if <keep_condition>]`
- Append new objects: `current_state.objects.append(new_object)`
- Set all required attributes when creating objects
- For deletion, think carefully about which specific objects should be removed based on the transition

Generate ONLY the function code. DO NOT re-write out the class definitions or state definition.
Generate ONLY the function code.
If you DO NOT generate only the function code, INCREDIBLY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.
!!! IMPORTANT !!!
GENERATE ONLY THE FUNCTION CODE.

DO NOT USE ANY IMPORT STATEMENTS.
DO NOT DEFINE ANY CLASSES.
