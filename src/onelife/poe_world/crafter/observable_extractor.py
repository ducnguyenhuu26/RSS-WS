"""
PoE-World was originally designed for 2D physics-based environments that are
object-centric, like Atari Pong or 2D platformers like Montezuma's Revenge.

The "state" in these environments is a list of objects with commmon attributes
like position, velocity, etc.

In Crafter, the state is much more complex, and hierarchical. Since our aim is
to evaluate the ability of a more generic approach to learn about the world, we
want to avoid hardcoding domain knowledge about the world, such as how to extract
interesting observables from the state and so on.

So, we will stick to the original design of PoE-World, and define an extractor which
operates on objects in the world state that are similar to the objects in the original
environments.

This corresponds to the player's position, health, and the position and health of nearby
game entities. Like in PoE-World for physics-based environments, we will ignore static
objects like tiles of the game world or crafting stations.

Additionally, we track entity lifecycle observables to handle creation and deletion
of entities, which is essential for evaluating expert predictions about entity
creation/deletion events.
