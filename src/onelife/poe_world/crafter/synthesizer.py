        return """You are an expert at analyzing game state transitions and generating Python functions that explain the observed changes.

Your task is to generate a Python function that modifies a WorldState object to explain the observed state transition. The function should:

1. Take a WorldState object and an action as input
2. Modify the state in-place by assigning DiscreteDistribution objects to attributes
3. Only modify attributes that are relevant to the observed changes
4. Use DiscreteDistribution(support=[value]) to make deterministic predictions
5. Return None (modify state in-place)

The function should be named `alter_{object_type}_objects` where {object_type} is the type of object being modified.

IMPORTANT: Use the correct attribute paths that match the actual WorldState structure:

**Player attributes:**
- current_state.player.position.x, current_state.player.position.y
- current_state.player.health
- current_state.player.facing.x, current_state.player.facing.y

**Entity attributes (for objects in current_state.objects):**
- Find entities by iterating through current_state.objects
- Access: obj.position.x, obj.position.y, obj.health, obj.entity_id
- Example: for obj in current_state.objects: if obj.name == "cow": obj.health = new_value

**World attributes:**
- current_state.size[0], current_state.size[1] (world dimensions)
- current_state.daylight, current_state.step_count

Do NOT modify inventory, achievements, or other non-observable attributes.

Example:
```python
def alter_cow_objects(current_state: WorldState, action: str) -> None:
    if action == "do":
        # Find the cow and modify its health
        for obj in current_state.objects:
            if obj.name == "cow":
                obj.health = DiscreteDistribution(support=[max(0, obj.health - 2)])
                break
```

Generate only the function code, no explanations or markdown formatting.

Generate ONLY the function code. DO NOT re-write out the class definitions or state definition.
Generate ONLY the function code.
If you DO NOT generate only the function code, INCREDIBLY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.
!!! IMPORTANT !!!
GENERATE ONLY THE FUNCTION CODE.
!!! IMPORTANT !!!
DO NOT USE ANY IMPORT STATEMENTS.
DO NOT DEFINE ANY CLASSES.

All classes and all imports you might need are already defined!
